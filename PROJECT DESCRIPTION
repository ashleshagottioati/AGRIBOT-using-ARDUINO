## **Detailed Description of AGRIBOT: Advanced Mobile Phone Operated Multi-Purpose Agriculture Robotic Vehicle**

### **Introduction**
AGRIBOT is a smart, mobile-controlled robotic system designed to automate various farming activities. Developed by a team under Mrs. N. Krishna Jyothi, AGRIBOT addresses key agricultural challenges in India such as labor shortages, inefficient irrigation, and the lack of precision farming. It uses embedded systems, IoT sensors, and mobile connectivity to perform tasks like soil ploughing, seed sowing, irrigation, and real-time crop monitoring.

### **Key Objectives**
1. Automatically monitor soil moisture and trigger irrigation.
2. Mechanically plough soil and remove weeds.
3. Sow seeds at fixed intervals with consistency.
4. Send real-time updates to farmers via SMS.
5. Allow remote operation using a mobile app and Bluetooth.

### **Hardware Components**
- **Arduino UNO**: Acts as the central controller.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures the water level in soil.
- **L293D Motor Driver**: Controls motors for movement and ploughing.
- **DC Motors**: Power wheels, plougher, and seed sowing unit.
- **GSM Module**: Sends SMS notifications to the farmer.
- **Water Pump**: Activates irrigation when soil is dry.
- **Bluetooth Module**: Enables control through a smartphone.
- **Power Supply**: 12V battery, with potential solar panel support.

---

### **Software Components**
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to program the Arduino UNO.
- **C/C++**: Programming language for controlling logic and components.
- **Mobile App**: Used to control robot functions like movement and seed sowing remotely via Bluetooth.

### **Working Principle**
1. **Soil Moisture Detection**  
   The moisture sensor checks soil dryness. If dry, it triggers the water pump. Once optimal moisture is reached, the pump turns off. A message is sent to the farmer via GSM.

2. **Ploughing and Movement**  
   The robotâ€™s movement (forward, backward, left, right) is controlled by the mobile app. A motor controls the plougher for tilling and weed removal.

3. **Seed Sowing**  
   Seeds placed in a container are dropped at regular intervals using a DC motor as the robot moves through the field.

4. **Communication**  
   Bluetooth enables real-time commands from the farmer, and the GSM module keeps the farmer informed of the robot's activity.
